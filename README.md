# Deliverable 1 - Artificial Intelligence ü§ñ
By: Luciana Hoyos P√©rez, Juan Jos√© G√≥mez V√©lez and Santiago Manco Maya

**Technologies used:** Jupiter Notebooks (Python).

## Search Agent üó∫Ô∏è

In this section, we developed a **Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm** to solve the classic problem of the *Wolf, the Sheep, and the Cabbage*.

The challenge consists of a farmer who needs to ferry a wolf, a sheep, and a cabbage across a river. The farmer can only carry one item at a time, and must ensure that the wolf is never left alone with the sheep, nor the sheep with the cabbage, as one would eat the other.

## Genetic Algorithm üß¨  

In this section, we implemented a **Genetic Algorithm** to automatically design a **weekly workout routine**.  

The algorithm generates and optimizes a 7-day training schedule that balances different muscle groups (Back, Chest, Legs, Arms) while ensuring enough rest days and avoiding overtraining.
