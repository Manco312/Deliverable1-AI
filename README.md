By: Luciana Hoyos P√©rez, Juan Jos√© G√≥mez V√©lez and Santiago Manco Maya

**Technologies used:** Jupiter Notebooks (Python).

## Search Agent üó∫Ô∏è

In this section, we developed a **Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm** to solve the classic problem of the *Wolf, the Goat, and the Cabbage*.

The challenge consists of a farmer who needs to ferry a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river. The farmer can only carry one item at a time, and must ensure that the wolf is never left alone with the goat, nor the goat with the cabbage, as one would eat the other.
